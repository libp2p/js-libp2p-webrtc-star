# Deployment

libp2p-webrtc-star is integrated with the [libp2p Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/libp2p) organization. Docker containers are built for passing CI to the `master` branch and to `tags`. The libp2p infra team leverages these containers to deploy and host webrtc-star services for users to test with. These servers should **not be relied on for Production applications**. If you wish to leverage webrtc-star servers for your application, we recommend running your own as we currently do not guarantee uptime of these servers.
